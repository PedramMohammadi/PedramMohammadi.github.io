            <p>
                I am currently working as a Senior Video Quality Engineer at <a href="https://netint.com/" target="_blank">NETINT Technologies Inc.</a> 
                My focus is on developing algorithms that enhance the objective and subjective visual quality of images and videos for NETINT's next generation 
                Video Processing Units (VPUs). I also specialize in developing and optimizing video encoding processes, and implementing cutting-edge video compression 
                algorithms for different codecs such as AVC, HEVC, and AV1 to deliver superior streaming experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
                Prior to joining NETINT, I worked as a Senior Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) 
                consultant at <a href="https://kpmg.com/ca/en/home.html" target="_blank">KPMG LLP</a> to support businesses in their pursuit of innovation. This role 
                required a deep understanding of both the technical intricacies and the financial implications of R&D projects. I gained valuable skills in project 
                management, client collaboration, and strategic planning, all of which have enriched my professional toolkit. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I received my PhD from <a href="https://www.ubc.ca/" target="_blank">The University of British Columbia</a> in 
                Electrical and Computer Engineering. During this time, I was part of the <a href="https://dml.ece.ubc.ca/index.html" target="_blank">Digital Multimedia Lab (DML)</a>
                and conducted research in the field of High Dynamic Range (HDR) video processing. My work during this time resulted in patented techniques that have 
                been successfully implemented in the industry, bridging the gap between academic research and real-world applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                I completed my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Electrical Engineering - Communication Systems at 
                <a href="https://en.um.ac.ir/" target="_blank">Ferdowsi University of Mashhad</a>. My work during this time was 
                focused on understanding the Human Visual System's (HVS) behavior and how it perceives visual quality to help develop 
                an objective video quality evaluation metric.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am deeply passionate about algorithm development in the field of image and video processing, with a keen interest 
                in exploring the entire lifecycle from research and inception of the idea to product development. I thrive on the challenge of pioneering 
                new solutions and am committed to contributing to advancements that shape the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm always open to connect with like-minded individuals and learn from their experiences and explore possible 
                collaborations. If youâ€™d like to chat, feel free to send me an <a href="mailto:pedram.mohammadi.eng@gmail.com" target="_blank">email</a>
