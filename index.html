            <h1>Pedram Mohammadi</h1>
            <p>Senior Video Quality Engineer - Vancouver, Canada</p>
            <p>
                I am currently working as a Senior Video Quality Engineer at <a href="https://netint.com/" target="_blank">NETINT Technologies Inc.</a> My focus is on developing algorithms that 
                enhance the objective and subjective visual quality of images and videos for NETINT's next generation Video Processing Units (VPUs). Aside from algorithm 
                development, I define visual quality guidelines for company's different product lines. I also specialize in developing and optimizing video encoding 
                processes, ensuring that our clients receive the highest visual quality video content with minimal latency and maximum efficiency. My other responsibilities 
                involves rigorous testing, analysis, and implementation of cutting-edge video compression algorithms for different codecs such as AVC, HEVC, and AV1 
                to deliver superior streaming experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
                Prior to joining <a href="https://netint.com/" target="_blank">NETINT</a> I worked as a Senior Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) 
                consultant at <a href="https://kpmg.com/ca/en/home.html" target="_blank">KPMG LLP</a> to support businesses in their pursuit of innovation. At KPMG, I was part of a 
                dynamic team dedicated to helping clients maximize their SR&ED tax credits. This role required a deep understanding of both the technical intricacies and the 
                financial implications of R&D projects. My time at KPMG honed my ability to translate complex scientific concepts into actionable insights for businesses, ensuring 
                they could fully benefit from available incentives. I gained valuable skills in project management, client collaboration, and strategic planning, all of 
                which have enriched my professional toolkit.
