                I am currently working as a Senior Video Quality Engineer at <a href="https://netint.com/" target="_blank">NETINT Technologies Inc.</a> My focus is on developing algorithms that 
                enhance the objective and subjective visual quality of images and videos for NETINT's next generation Video Processing Units (VPUs). Aside from algorithm 
                development, I define visual quality guidelines for company's different product lines. I also specialize in developing and optimizing video encoding 
                processes, ensuring that our clients receive the highest visual quality video content with minimal latency and maximum efficiency. My other responsibilities 
                involves rigorous testing, analysis, and implementation of cutting-edge video compression algorithms for different codecs such as AVC, HEVC, and AV1 
                to deliver superior streaming experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
                Prior to joining NETINT, I worked as a Senior Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) 
                consultant at <a href="https://kpmg.com/ca/en/home.html" target="_blank">KPMG LLP</a> to support businesses in their pursuit of innovation. At KPMG, I was part of a 
                dynamic team dedicated to helping clients maximize their SR&ED tax credits. This role required a deep understanding of both the technical intricacies and the 
                financial implications of R&D projects. My time at KPMG honed my ability to translate complex scientific concepts into actionable insights for businesses, ensuring 
                they could fully benefit from available incentives. I gained valuable skills in project management, client collaboration, and strategic planning, all of 
                which have enriched my professional toolkit.

            <p>
                I received my PhD from <a href="https://www.ubc.ca/" target="_blank">The University of British Columbia</a> in 
                Electrical and Computer Engineering. During this time, I was part of the <a href="https://dml.ece.ubc.ca/index.html" target="_blank">Digital Multimedia Lab (DML)</a>
                and conducted research in the field of High Dynamic Range (HDR) video processing. My work focused on developing 
                algorithms to convert Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) content to HDR, with the goal of achieving highest possible 
                visual quality. These patented techniques have been successfully implemented in the industry, bridging the gap 
                between academic research and real-world applications. Collaborating with industry leaders, I was able to translate 
                theoretical advancements into practical solutions, paving the way for commercial adoption and demonstrating the 
                practical relevance of my work.
            </p>
            <p>
                I completed my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Electrical Engineering - Communication Systems in 
                <a href="https://en.um.ac.ir/" target="_blank">Ferdowsi University of Mashhad</a>. My work during this time was 
                focused on understanding the Human Visual System's (HVS) behavior and how it perceives visual quality to help develop 
                an objective video quality evaluation metric for assessing the visual quality of HDR content. My work resulted in a 
                survey paper that has been widely recognized in the academic community, with 298 citations in prestigious journals and 
                conferences, underscoring its influence and contribution to the field.

                I am deeply passionate about algorithm development in the field of image and video processing, with a keen interest 
                in exploring the entire lifecycle from research and inception of the idea to product development. My goal is to work 
                on groundbreaking projects that push the boundaries of what is possible, focusing on novel areas that have the 
                potential to make a significant impact. I thrive on the challenge of pioneering new solutions and am committed to 
                contributing to advancements that shape the future.
