                        The drastic visual improvements introduced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range" target="_blank">HDR</a> 
                        technologies open new markets for a wide range of industries. In this project, through modeling 
                        the behavior of the human eye, we propose a novel high visual quality video inverse Tone Mapping Operator (iTMO) that addresses the 
                        inadequacies of the state-of-the-art methods, resulting in high visual quality HDR videos that match the capabilities of the HDR technology. 
                        This algorithm uses a hybrid approach to achieve an optimal balance between the overall contrast and brightness of the output HDR frame 
                        by maximizing a weighted sum of contrast and brightness difference between input SDR and generated HDR frame. 

                        Our subjective evaluations demonstrated that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing methods by an average of 75% in terms of 
                        visual quality. Further testing using <a href="https://hdrvdp.sourceforge.net/wiki/" target="_blank">HDR VDP</a> and 
                        <a href="https://github.com/gfxdisp/pu21" target="_blank">PU-SSIM</a> objective quality metrics demonstrated that our 
                        algorithm outperforms existing methods on a wide variety of input content.

                        Rate control module is a critical component of a video encoder, especially for low-delay applications such as cloud gaming, 
                        live streaming, and video conferencing. It ensures that video data is transmitted efficiently and smoothly, maintaining high visual 
                        quality while adapting to varying network conditions and content complexity. In this work, we developed a frame-level 
                        video rate control algorithm for <a href="https://netint.com/" target="_blank">NETINT Technologies's</a> next-generation 
                        Video Processing Units (VPUs). Our algorithm is content adaptive, delivering outstanding performance improvements in terms of BD-rate. 
                        These enhancements are codec-agnostic, demonstrating consistent gains across AVC, HEVC, and AV1 codecs. Our algorithm achieves an 
                        average of 10% improvement in BD-rate compared to previous generation encoders, reflecting its efficiency in maintaining high visual 
                        quality at reduced bitrates.

                        Maintaining consistent luminance is crucial for delivering high-quality viewing experiences. 
                        Unwanted fluctuations in brightness, often perceived as flickering, can detract from the visual appeal and clarity of images 
                        and videos. In this work, we address this challenge by implementing a condition on any brightness conversion that limits brightness 
                        fluctuations to less than one Just Noticeable Difference (JND), effectively preventing perceptible flickering. 
                        By ensuring that changes in brightness remain below the human threshold of detection, our algorithm guarantees a stable and 
                        consistent luminance output, enhancing the viewer's experience.

                            is an attractive proposition to SDR content owners and real-time broadcasters. In this work, we proposed a novel content

                            areas of a scene. By processing each frame indepently, our algorithms assigns different weights to different regions of a scene 
                            depending on their pixel distribution. Our subjective evaluations indicate that our proposed method outperforms other 
                            state-of-the-art methods by an average of 80% in terms of visual quality. In addition to subjective evaluations, 
                            we also performed objective evaluations using HDR-VDP and PU-SSIM metrics and concluded that, on average, 
                            our proposed iTMO outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of these two metrics.

                            to their intended appearance despite variations in lighting and display conditions. As brightness levels change, the hue and saturation 
                            of colors can be unintentionally altered, leading to discrepancies that affect the visual quality and accuracy of images.
                            In this project, we developed a novel color adjustment algorithm designed to effectively manage changes in hue as brightness levels

                            rate control analyzes the video content in two stages, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of both current and future
